# UDP_Socket_programming
UDP (Use Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless transmission model with a minimum of protocol mechanism. It has no handshaking dialogues and no mechanism of acknowledgements (ACKs). Therefore, every packet delivered by using UDP protocol is not guaranteed to be received, but UDP avoids unnecessary delay, thanks to its simplicity.
